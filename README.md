# Asphalt-Defect-Classification-Using-CNN

The advancement of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has revolutionized image classification and segmentation tasks across various domains. One such critical application is the inspection and classification of pavement defects, which is essential for maintaining infrastructure integrity and ensuring public safety.
     The classification of defects in asphalt images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has been significantly advanced by the availability of large-scale datasets and deep learning techniques. This study focuses on the development of a CNN model for the classification of pavement defects using the Pavementscapes dataset.
     The Pavementscapes dataset comprises 4,000 images, each with a resolution of 1024Ã—2048 pixels. These images were captured during real-world pavement inspection projects involving 15 different types of pavements. Importantly, each image in the dataset has been meticulously annotated at the pixel level, encompassing six distinct damage classes and totaling 8,680 instances of pavement damage.
     The objective of this assignment is to explore and implement state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for pavement damage classification. This encompasses rigorous data preprocessing, the design of a suitable model architecture, training, evaluation, and the reporting of performance metrics for the developed CNN model.
     The significance of this work lies in its potential to automate and improve the accuracy of pavement defect detection, thereby supporting infrastructure management and maintenance strategies. By leveraging deep learning on large-scale annotated datasets like Pavementscapes, advancements in the field of civil engineering and infrastructure management through advanced computer vision techniques are facilitated.
